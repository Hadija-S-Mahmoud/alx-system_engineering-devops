## Issue Summary
# Duration of the Outage:
* Date: June 7, 2024 
* Time: from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM UTC

# Impact 
* The primary web application was down, resulting in 80% of users being unable to access the service. Users experienced timeout errors and were unable to perform any actions on the platform.

# Root Cause
* A misconfiguration in the database replication setup caused a cascading failure that overloaded the primary database server.

# Timeline
10:00 AM - Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high response times and timeouts.
10:05 AM - On-call engineer confirmed the issue and began initial investigation.
10:15 AM - Database team was alerted as the issue seemed to be related to database performance.
10:20 AM - Initial assumption was high traffic causing the database overload.
10:45 AM - Traffic analysis showed normal levels, misleading the team away from traffic-related causes.
11:00 AM - Further investigation revealed replication lag in the database.
11:15 AM - Misleading path explored: Possible network issues causing replication delays.
11:30 AM - Network team confirmed no network issues, directing focus back to database configuration.
11:45 AM - Detailed review of database logs indicated misconfiguration in the replication setup.
12:00 PM - Database configuration corrected, and replication lag began to reduce.
12:30 PM - Full service restored, and monitoring showed normal operation.

# Root Cause and Resolution
# Root Cause: 
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the database replication setup. A recent update intended to improve replication performance inadvertently introduced a configuration error that caused the secondary database to lag significantly. This lag led to an overload on the primary database server as it attempted to handle an increased load of read and write requests.

# Resolution: 
The issue was resolved by reverting the misconfigured settings in the database replication setup. The database team identified the incorrect parameters, updated the configuration to the previous stable state, and restarted the replication process. This immediately reduced the load on the primary database, allowing it to handle requests normally. Continuous monitoring was set up to ensure that replication lag remained within acceptable limits.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures
# Improvements/Fixes:

* Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring for database replication lag and database load metrics.
* Configuration Review: Establish a more rigorous review process for configuration changes, especially for critical components like the database.
* Incident Response Training: Conduct regular training for the engineering team on incident response and root cause analysis to improve efficiency in future incidents.

# Tasks:
* Add Monitoring on Database Replication Lag: Set up alerts for any unusual increase in replication lag.
* Patch Database Configuration: Update the database configuration with the corrected settings and document the changes.
* Review and Document Configuration Changes: Create a standardized checklist and approval process for all configuration changes.
* Incident Response Drills: Schedule quarterly drills to simulate outages and practice incident resolution.
* Improve Logging: Enhance logging for database operations to provide more detailed insights during future incidents.
